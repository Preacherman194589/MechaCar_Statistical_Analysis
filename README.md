**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

Based on the summary of the dataset, it appears that vehicle_length (2.60e..) and the ground_clearance (5.21e..)shows a non-random amount of variance. Both numbers are considered very small, as well as the intercept. This is also based on the Signif. codes. A non-random is a single value that does not vary, having a zero variance. 

**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

No, the slope is not considered to be zero,if that was the case then the 'y-intercept' would be consistant and the slope would be hortizontal and not vertical. Here we see the slope varies based on dependant and the independant variables and their coefficients.


**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

Based on the numbers, the Multiple R-Squared allows us to see the percentage of certtainity of correction. Based on the numbers of 71.4 the mpg of MechaCar prototypes can be predict effectivilty, and the actual of the linear model predition.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Which metric will be interest to a consumer?cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.


### In your description, address the following questions:

**What metric or metrics are you going to test?**

**What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?**

**What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?**

**What data is needed to run the statistical test?**
